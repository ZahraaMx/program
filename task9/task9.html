                  <h2>Optimism brings happiness</h2>

                  <p>The future expands the space of hope and incites action. It is the broadest horizon, it is the liberation from the narrowness of the moment and the gloom of the present, it is the deliverance from the dependence on the present, and the annoying problems, it is the salvation and the rebellion against the temporal and spatial constraints, and it is the non-compliance with the bitter reality, and the confident and optimistic action.
